# Knights Game

Knights game is a GUI puzzle game to challenge the player to capture all pawns in a given grid size in the least number of moves possible. This project's true purpose was to experiment with artificial search techniques that can automatically solve the puzzle for you. The search techniques used are:

  - Breadth First Search - Large search space, but most optimal
  - Depth First Search - Small search space, but never optimal
  - A* Heuristic - Self develop heuristic to attain small search space and a solution with high optimality

## Requirements
Python 2.7.x (2.7.10 development based)
wxPython Library (latest version)
numpy (latest version)

### Installation
Make sure you have the required libraries to boot, then just open up command line or shell:
